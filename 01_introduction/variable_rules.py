## Static vs Dynamic Typing:

  # Dynamic Typing (Python):  Types change during execution.
  # Static Typing:  Fixed types before runtime.
   # Static vs Dynamic Binding:

#Static Binding: Types fixed at compile-time.
#Dynamic Binding: Types associated at runtime, changeable during execution.
#Stylish Declaration Techniques:

# Clear, efficient variable/structure declarations in Python.
# Use Python's flexibility for concise, readable code.
  
# Rules for declaring variables.

# Common Variable Declaration Styles

styleCamelCase = "modernPython"
StylePascalCase = "ModernPython"
style_snake_case = "Modern_Python"
STYLEUPPERCASE = "I don't wanna change"
_super_secret = "My Password"
luckyNumber4 = "Looks it has a number!"
lucky_number_3 = "I too got a number"

# Dynamic Typing (PHP)
$a = 5;

# Static Typing (Java)
int a = 5;

# Dynamic Binding Example
a = 5          # Assign integer
print(a)

a = 'nitish'   # Reassign string
print(a)

# Static Binding Example
int a = 5

print(styleCamelCase)
print(StylePascalCase)
print(style_snake_case)
print(STYLEUPPERCASE)
print(_super_secret)
print(luckyNumber4)
print(lucky_number_3)

# Following are not valid variable declarations -

# 5_lucky_number = "Variable starting with number"
# my-variable = "Variables with hyphen"
# isLuckyNumber? = "Variables with special characters"
# $myName = "Variables starting with special characters"
# lucky number = "Variables with spaces"


# special syntax
a = 5;b=6;c=7
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

a,b,c = 4,5,6
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
